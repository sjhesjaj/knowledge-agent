"""Background Wiki compilation, and the live Wiki the chat path reads.

Two jobs, both owned here so `api.py` gains only wiring:

**A single-worker FIFO queue.** One upload becomes one job; one thread runs one
job at a time. The point is not throughput but the opposite: a 4B model
compiling two documents at once on a laptop makes both slow and neither
finishes sooner, so the queue is deliberately serial.

**The published-build pointer that the chat path reads per request.** Publishing
a build must take effect without restarting the API, so `current.json` is
consulted on each read and the pages are cached against the build id it names.

A batch is all-or-nothing at the publish step. Each document is compiled onto
the draft the previous one produced, and only the final draft is published - so
a batch that fails halfway leaves drafts on disk and the *live* Wiki exactly
where it was. That is the whole reason compilation is allowed to run unattended:
its failure mode is "nothing changed", not "the Wiki is now half-rewritten".

Job state lives in memory. It is lost on restart, which is acceptable for a
progress indicator and is not acceptable for the builds themselves - those are
on disk, which is why a lost job never loses compiled work.

Nothing here runs at import: no thread starts and no directory is created until
a job is submitted.
