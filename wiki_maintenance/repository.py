"""File-backed storage for document snapshots and Wiki builds.

Layout under the injected root:

```text
<root>/
├── documents/<document_id>/<version>.json   one document snapshot per version
├── builds/<build_id>.json                   one immutable build per file
├── manifest.json                            every build's lifecycle state
└── current.json                             which build is live
```

The split is the whole point. A build file is written once and never touched
again; `manifest.json` holds the status that changes and `current.json` holds
the pointer that moves. Publishing `build-0002` and rolling back to `build-0001`
therefore rewrite neither build - a rollback restores nothing, it only points
somewhere else, which is why it cannot lose or corrupt what was published.

`manifest.json` and `current.json` are replaced through a temporary file in the
same directory, so an interrupted write leaves the previous state readable
rather than a half-written pointer.

Scope: one process, one writer. There is no lock, no lease and no transaction
across the two files; a concurrent second writer is out of scope for this
milestone and would need real coordination rather than a bigger `try`.
